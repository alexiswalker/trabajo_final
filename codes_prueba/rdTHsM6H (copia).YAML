    Maki Harukawa:
      - I've been spending all my time in my research lab, just going back to my room to shower.
      - Gonta tried to capture me last night, but I threatened him to make him go away.
      - I told him he would choke on his own tongue.
  Stray Thoughts:
    - Someone could have done a Tarzan swing across the pool in the inner tube from Ryoma's bathroom to the gym.
    - Ryoma could have been drowned in his bathroom sink, handcuffed and wearing the inner tube. Then he was dragged (via the rope on the inner tube) across the bathroom, across the pool, and then into the gym. That would explain the scratch marks all those places.
