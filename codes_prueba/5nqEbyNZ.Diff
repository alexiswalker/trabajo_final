>The elevator goes up not so quick but either so slow
>Perfectly smooth how is supposed to be
>The necklace that Shade gave you and you don’t any distraction from your thoughts
>Those photos of Green Hornet reminded you of your childhood and how everything went to the hell due to the whims of destiny
>The sole idea of ruin that small and happy filly’s life concerns you
>And your concern is quite obvious due to the swirl you hang in your neck
>”You look kinda sad, how are you feeling?”
“Yes… I’m worried”
>”Why?”
“Well… I don’t know if this is a good idea. What if I make a mistake and I ruin innocent lives?”
>She ponds for a while ”I don’t think that you’re gonna do such a thing. If Sunset choose you it must have been for a good reason”
>You just sight
“If you say so…”
>A beep announces that you arrived and the door slowly opens letting in the sunlight inside
>You walk outside with Lyra
“I have to admit, I’m still impressed by the scenery of this world”
>”Yeah, it’s a nice place”
“It was weird to use that elevator without getting inju-”
>”Anom! Watch out!” screams Lyra but before you can react something small and hard hits you
>You fall on the floor and then you pass out
>...
>You open your eyes with some confusion. You see a blurred blue head with two giant eyes and an orange square in the middle
>”Are you OK? I’m so sorry, I didn’t see you” it sounds like a scared little girl
>You just shake your head and then you make a quick jump to stand on two legs.
“Who was?” and you throw some punches in the air
>”Anom-” and you put your hoof in Lyra mouth before she can say anything else
“Shhh… the enemy must be hiding somewhere”
>The only person (or horse in this case) you can see other than Lyra is an orange filly pegasus with a blue helmet on her head, a saddlebag, and a scooter
>That pegasus looks kinda nervous “In fact… it was me”
>Wait for a second
>You know who she is
>”I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt you. I was distracted…”
“Hey…” and you bend your neck doing a little crack sound “I would be lying if I say that you are the first girl who hit on me” and you wig your eyebrow
>Scootalo doesn’t understand your joke but Lyra in the other hand clears her throat
“I mean… you need a little more than that to hurt me. My name is Anom, and you are?”
>”Scootalo…” she still looks a bit embarrassed
>The scooter that shocked you it’s made of wood and has a metal handle and four plastic wheels. It reminds you of a skateboard you had in your childhood
“Wow, this looks so cool!”
>”Really?... I mean, I know. I did it myself!” and she now is pretty proud of her handcrafted sport equipment
“Can… I try it?” you want to know if you still have the touch to ride it
>”You know how to use it?”
“Sure! Some time ago I was an excellent skater, it’s a piece of cake”
>”Okay, but before…” and she puts her helmet on your head “safety first”
>You accommodate the helmet because it’s covering your eyes and then you feel a weird weight on your back… Is it a saddlebag?
>Kinda weird how you forgot that you had one, it felt so natural the whole time.
“Whatever, check it out!”
>And you lay your front legs on the handle and then you propose the skateboard with a kick on the ground
>You move very slowly a few meters and then you lose the balance face-planting on the floor
>Scootalo try to hide her laugh as she helps you to stand again
>”That… wasn’t very good”
“Yeah”
>”You said that you were a good skater”
>Maybe you had to remember that that “time ago” was almost 10 years ago, without to mention that you have a new body with a different balance than before.
“I exaggerated… I always wanted to have a skate and learn to use it, I guess it’s not for me…” you try to justify your lack of talent in something that even a kid can do better
>”Don’t be so pessimistic, you only need to learn to use it”
“Yeah, I guess so” you laugh awkwardly
>”You.. are new here, don’t you?”
“What gave me away?”
>”Well, to begin with, your accent it’s kinda different from anypony I have ever known and I never saw you before”
“I guess you know everybody in this town…”
>”It’s not a big city, it’s easy to have seen everypony at least once. By the way, you just made it more obvious”
>”How so?”
“Nopony here says ‘everybody’, where are you from?”
>”Mmm…”
>Think! You try to remember the map that you saw at Sunset’s office to know what to say. It must be a place that sounds to be like Buenos Aires but nobody in the show has ever mentioned too much.
“Ba… Baltimare!”
>”Baltimare?” she ponds for a while “I never heard about there…”
>Fair enough
>”Hey! I have an idea, would you like to take a city tour with me?”
“It would be fun, but why?”
>”Because it’s one of my duties like a Cutie Mark Crusader and who knows, maybe we could find out your talent, gaining your cutie mark would be a great way to start your life here”
>Damn kids and their enthusiasm, you don’t know whether to be happy for her positivism or embarrassed for her simple way to think. But, it worth a shot to relax for a while of your through
“Sounds cool…” you turn your head to Lyra who looks happy to see you less depressed than before in the elevator “Can I go? Pretty pleeeeease” you make your best puppy eyes
>”Okay Anom, but try to behave”
“What are you talking about? I’m a good gentle… colt” you can’t say that word without a cringe.
>She raises an eyebrow and then she sighs “I’m gonna trust you. By the way, Bonbon and I we were going to a see a junior ballet function in the city theater at afternoon, we could meet there”
>You nod and she strokes your mane, as your face gets red like a tomato
“Lyra! Not in front of she, you’re embarrassing me”
>She just grins “Oh, really? I’m so sorry~”
>Is she making it on purpose?
>Whatever, you’re gonna get your revenge but for now, she just leaves


----

>With Lyra gone out, you are alone with that cute pegasus
>”So, where we should go first? The Sugarcube Corner or maybe the Friendship Castle It's pretty cool, you know?”
>Any of that sounds good, but you don't want to be a nuisance, she sure had to do something else to do before hitting you.
“I don't know… what were you to do anyway? You know, before meeting me”
>”I was about to practice some bungee jumping”
“Sweet! Would you mind… if I accompany you?”
>”Mmm… ok”
>The both of you walk through the city
>”So, are you Lyra’s family?”
“She's my aunt”
>”Oh I see, she looks very nice”
“Certainly she is, by the way, you mentioned to be a member of the ‘Cutie Mark Crusaders’ where are the other ones?”
>It’s quite strange how she was alone, they were together most time on the show
“Yeah… we decided to take different paths today to try something else”
>That sounds familiar…
”I guess is right… if you spend too much time with somebo… pony you end up getting tired of his company”
>”Tired? That does not make any sense, we are great friends after all”
“Yeah, but sometimes you need to get your own time to think clearly or even enjoy thing on your own”
>She now looks a little sad, damn, maybe you need to be less straight-up. They are really close to each other
>What if you separate them?
>No!
>You can be responsible for break up a so great team of fillies who are so helpful to everyone around and are so happy together
>You need to say something to let her hopes up
“Look at the bright side, the next time you'll see them again, you are gonna have something interesting to talk about”
>But when you look at her again, you can't see her. You are in an apple orchard and you hear a scream in the distance “Anon! Over here” Scootalo is far away and you run up to her
>She looks happy and that’s a relief. Her youthful and cheerful mind can only be depressed for existential questions for so long. You certainly envy her
“Where we are? Is this Sweet Apple Acres?”
>”Yes” she cocks an eyebrow “how do you know it”
>Damm
“Mmm… Lyra told me about”
>”Ah ok”
“Why are we here? You came here to pick apples?”
>”To do some bungee jumping, how you forgot?”
“Oh right!”
>”Just follow me”
>And she leaves her skateboard to began to climb the three.
>Wait a second… how she is gonna do it with hooves, HOW YOU ARE GONNA DO IT WITH FUCKING HOOVES?!
>She does it without any trouble, but you on the other side…
“Hmm… do you know how to climb, right?”
>”I’m on it!”
>After an embarrassing while of trial and error, you realize how to do it.
>At morning when you tried to… do that… you learned how these hooves can be like little pads and inflate in determined areas of your flog to manipulate stuff.
>Them even can adapt to the wrinkle of the tree
>That’s quite strange, but it would be more strange that the evolution process didn’t lead to a dominant species to be able to manipulate tools without fancy magic
>With that you finally climb that damn tree
>It’s a new kind of experience using this body control
>You has an evil grin thinking how many fun you’re gonna have with these hooves
>No, no. Fucking naughty mind, stop having this kind of thoughts, you’re with a filly now
>I like fillies~
>I said shut-up!
>”Hey, why so many troubles down there?”
“Hmmm… Baltimare doesn’t have trees, I didn’t climb one in a while”
>”Oh I see, well let’s do this”
>With you up on the tree, she takes off her saddle bag and takes out a vest and a flexible cord. She ties one extreme of the cord on the tree branch where you two are and the other extreme at the vest back. She then she puts on the vest.
>”Okay, pay attention and watch” and she just jumps off and you watch in owe to the ground.
>Scootalo comes back to the branch immediately “It was pretty easy”
“Yeah, you’re pretty good at this”
>”It’s not that hard, in fact, it was my first time. Wanna try?”
>Her first time? Well, his talent is to make extreme sports but you… no. This could be dangerous, your body is too new to try this kind of stuff
“I don’t know if is a good idea… don’t you want to do it again?”
>”Come on, what are you? A scaredy cat?” she has a smug smile
“What? First of all, cats are cool as hell and secondly… give that helmet and vest, I’m gonna teach you who I’m, silly filly~”
>Ready to jump you see at the bottom and you gulp “There’s any problem?” she screams from the other side
“Not at all, this is easy peasy” and you jump with your eyes closed.
>You open them to see the floor coming to you and you scream like Tom the cat to then go back to the branch, but instead of that, you jump over the tree and then going to the sides making you rolling around the branch like some crazy needle clock. Finally, you are wrapped by the cord back where did you jump.
>Upside on the branch Scootalo is doing her best try to not laugh at you without success and finally laughing her ass off.
“Hey, it was not funny! I did it on purpose” you have an unamused face but her laughs catch you and you can’t help but join her.
>”Do you need a hoof?” she asks you after she wakes to you.
“It would be helpful” you feel a bit embarrassed for needing her help.
>She unwraps you with caution to don’t making you failing on the floor.
>After you are free again you thanks her
“Thank you for the help, hehe, what do you want to do now?”
>”I don’t know, any idea?” and a growl from your stomach catches both of your attention
“What about some food? I skipped breakfast today”
>”We could go back to the town and eat something…”
“Wait for a second, it’s not necessary…” and you look inside your saddlebag “I still have the sandwiches that Bonbon made this morning… do you want one?”
“Sure!” and you give her one of the sandwiches.
>She sits on the branch as you lay your back on the trunk of the tree eating your meal.
“A nice view, a delicious food and a cool friend, what else I could ask for?”
>She makes a little laugh in answer
“What's so funny?”
>”You are so weird…”
“Weird?”
>“I mean a good way, I don't know how to say it”
”Thank God, I was expecting the worst”
>”But…” She ponds for a while “You're kinda clumsy”
“Yeah…”
>“I mean, it didn't have passed a day since we meet us and you had already three accidents”
”Hey, the first one it wasn't my fault if I recall correctly…”
>”Point taken, but still, it's weird how you have so much bad luck…”
“Oh, knew that I only could hide my curse for so long…”
>”Curse?”
“I didn't want to talk about the subject, but you'll see when I was born a powerful evil wizard cursed me to have bad luck…” and you sigh looking down
>She gasps “seriously? I'm sorry?”
“You totally fell for it…”…” you snicker with a shit-eating grin
>She slightly punches your shoulder “I was pretending…”
“Of course…”
>”Hey I should go back with the girls, want to come?”
“I’m not sure, I don’t want to be a nuisance”
>She starts to climb down the three as keep sitting without moving
“I don’t think so, but there’s a problem…”
>”And that's it..?”
“That you can’t catch me!” and she gets on the skateboard to run
>You hop off the branch to trot to her “Hey! It’s not fair! Wait for me!”
>The running feels so good, the wind waves your mane and tale and instinctively you start to flap your wings.
>The place is pretty good looking, you see the sun rays go through the tree leaves impregnating the almost wild but dainty vegetation. The Cyclades sound fills the air with some birds as well
>As you’re lost in your throughs you hear a scream “Having problems to keep my pace?”
>You return to the real world to accelerate and you finally reach her, but she already stopped
>And behind her, there’s a small white tree house with hearts on the windows. Definitely, this is the CMC clubhouse.
“Here I’m!”
>”Why you took so long?”
“I was admiring the scenery,” you say with certain irony tone in your voice
>”Hi!” a squeaky voice screams behind you
>When you turn your head to see the origin of that sounds, you see a small white unicorn filly with lavender curls
>”Hi Scootaloo... “ And then she glances you in confusion “Hi…” and she looks at the orange pegasus “Who is he?”
,
--
>”This is Anom, he's new here”
“New?”
>Scootaloo nods “He's from Baltimare, he just moved here”
>”Baltimare mmm?”
“Yes! That's right, what's your name?”
>”I'm Sweetie Belle…” and she trots a little seeing with curiosity at your virgin butt cheek, trying without success to no catch your attention. You know what it means, but the best you can do is play around with it and act a little
“Why are you seeing my flank like that?” you move your tail to hide your cheek and making a shy expression
>”Me? I was just seeing something…” she says looking to the sides
“You mean… it’s because… my flank  is…” and you look at the floor with sternness “fat?”
>The white filly puts a confused expression “What?”
“I know, I know… it’s so big and meaty” and you put a hoof in your forehead closing your eyes to look sad saying that.
>”No… No…”
“It disgusts you?”
>”What? No...”
“So, why you looked like that… Do you like it?” and you wiggle your eyebrow
>”No!” she says unamused
“Come on Sweetie, you can touch it if you want. It doesn’t bite” and you blink her
>”Anom!” exclaims Scootalo bothered
“What happens, do you also want?”
>”No! She was looking at your flank because is… white”
“Ohh… I see”
>”It makes you feel bad to talk about that?”
“What you mean? It just a draw in your bu… back.... It doesn’t mean anything but what are you destined to be. I mean, what’s the worst it could happen? Have a wrong one and have a miserable life and the possibility to be isolated because you have a meaningless talent? Or even worst, don’t have one at all and being a useless pony without friends, family or life’s sense?”
>For some reason the sole idea of having a white flank it clicked how important it’s to have that stupid icon in your butt.
>Scootalo approaches you “Hey, don’t worry, sooner or later you’re gonna get your cutie mark”
>”Yes! That’s we are for. We as The Cutie Mark Crusaders have the mission to find and discover everypony talent” continues Sweetie Belle
>It’s pretty hard to feel sad with these fillies around
>MLPG posters would trade their souls to be in my shoes right now
>But there’s a solid fact, you’re not a “natural” equestrian pony and there’s an important chance that you’re not to get one
>Maybe you’re taking this too seriously, you need to ask Shade about the whole deal
>At least in the process to get one you have some fun and meet new friends
>”Hey, where’s Apple Bloom?” asks Scootalo to the unicorn
>”I don’t know… maybe we should check the clubhouse” pounds Sweetie
>With that, the three of you climb the stairs
>Inside the clubhouse it’s dark and you can only see the apple filly sit in a corner a giving you the back
>Apple Bloom turns her head to the girls and you “Havin’ fun with your new friend?”.
>She doesn’t look happy at all, in fact, she looks annoyed.
>Who shat in her cereal? You just appeared here.
>Maybe you should do an effort to remember if this was in an episode.
>”Hey Applebloom? Do you mind if I open the window, it looks kinda scary…”
“Yes… did she kill anyone?”
>Scootalo open a curtain and the walls and roof are full and full of papers, each one drawn with a red marker of ponies crossed out.
>You turn your face to the angry pony
“So... where did you hide the bodies?” you ask to the apple horsie as the fillies give you an awkward expression.
>You can barely remember where have you seen this.
>It doesn’t help that you saw almost every episode of this season drunk because at this point you only cared about the lore important ones and you didn’t pay too much attention to the slice of life kind of episodes.
>Let's see… there was one where the Crusaders tried to get their marks but they already had them, then they… made a concert and… mmm….
>Then they met a colt and they... danced together?
>Yes?
>No… there was more… Applebloom got crazy?
>Because…
>Crap you have no time for this, you have to act quick
“No, I swear”
>”He just appeared here, I met him in Ponyville.” Scootalo tries to calm her friend
>And Sweetie Belle adds “He’s a little weird...”
>”It must be because he’s from Baltimare” ponds for a while Scootaloo
>Sweetie Bell gasps “I heard that most ponies there wear pants, it’s that true Anom?”
“Hmmm… It is but I disagree with that because our bu-- flanks deserve to be free without any fabric repression”
>”You must feel weird without pants…” ponds Sweety
“Yeah, a bit. But I always wanted to walk around without any clothes without getting weird stares at me. And between you and me, It would be a shame if you had to hide that cute back” you wink her, she gives you an expression of confusion
>”Anyways, Apple Bloom why are you in such a bad mood, you usually are more joyfully to meet new recruits”
>She sighs “I know I know, I guess I flew off the handle. Y’all see. I was horsin’ around doing all kind of activities and it was so frustratin’! I felt out of place most of the time. I even tried to learn dance and I was a disaster. There I met a colt who was great dance, but he was scared to act to be on stage in some dance show”
“You mean the one at the city theater?”
>”How… did you know” asks the yellow apple filly.
“Because my auntie Lyra told me to meet her there with Bonbon at afternoon”
>Sweetie Belle ponds for a while “Maybe we could go there to help him out!”
>”Yes! He maybe he needs a little kick to do achieve his talent” Scootaloo cries “Crusaders in action!” and the three of them runs out of the house.
>You follow them through the city
>Again, it feels so satisfying trotting with these hooves.
>Minutes later the girls and you finally reach the theater
