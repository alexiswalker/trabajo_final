Behzat Ç. Bir Ankara Polisiyesi (2010)	9.3	2098	Centered around a personally troubled, officially discredited police chief and his inharmonious police team in Ankara Police Force. Even though the show usually focuses on murders and other crimes that happens on a weekly basis, the undertone of the story leads to an eventual duel between Behzat Ç. and the rotten department officials and bureaucrats. Derived from the Turkish writer Emrah Serbes's novels "Behzat Ç: Her Temas Iz Birakir" (2006) and "Behzat Ç: Son Hafriyat" (2010), the series tell the story of Chief Inspector Behzat Ç, leading the Homicide and Vice divisions of the Ankara Police Force. Struggling with a failed marriage, a dark past, a rebellious daughter and corrupt bureaucrats and police officers, Behzat Ç disregards procedure, political correctness and etiquette to pursue and arrest serial killers, hitmen and violent criminals. His underlings from the Homicide and Vice desk aid and assist him in this struggle: the hot tempered, headstrong Harun, the streetwise Hayalet (the "Ghost"), the self-trained forensics expert Akbaba (the "Vulture"), the naive and green Cevdet, and Selim and Eda, who try to maintain a healthy relationship amongst the toil and trouble of dealing with murder every day. Behzat's brother, Sevket Ç, who administers a shopping mall, also occasionally throws in help. Each episode deals with a different murder, while the main plot thickens after the main villain, Ercüment Çözer, a sadistic serial killer holding many bureaucrats on his payroll, along with his tireless assistant Memduh Basgan, a shady ex-Gladio hitman are introduced. Almost all episodes take place in Ankara, Turkey.
