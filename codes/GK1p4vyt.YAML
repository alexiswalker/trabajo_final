# It is possible to have multiple tab list configuration files.
# BungeeTabListPlus will parse all .yml files it finds in the tabLists directory.
# Which tab list a player sees depends on the showTo and priority options.

# All player see this tab list
showTo: "all"

# If after evaluating the showTo option of all tab list configs multiple tab lists
# are visible to a player, he will bw shown the one with the highest priority:
priority: 30
