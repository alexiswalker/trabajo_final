This will be an exploration of why X Factor USA failed. I've spoken to some (perhaps most) of these points elsewhere in this thread, but I'll just pile 'em all up in this post.

1. Bad Judges

I hesitate to call them "coaches" or "mentors" but I'm equally loath to call them "judges". They help their acts work out their performances on screen but to what extent they're committed is unknown and certainly varies between judges. They pick their acts' songs, except for when they don't. Also puzzling to me is that the demo group to which the judges are assigned is entirely out of their hands, and for the first two seasons they actively displayed judges' disappointment with their assigned groups. If they don't want to work with certain demos, then why should the viewer give a shit about that category? The intention is probably to create a comeback narrative where their judge may not have wanted to work with them before, but gosh darnit now they take it back because they wouldn't have it any other way. Live critiques on XFUSA vacillate between pithy positivity and outright hyperbole (not unusual for a singshow), but then there's the bullshit reality TV politicking between the judges. They're forcing chemistry where there is none. Did anyone watching S2 really think that Cowell and Reid had any issue with each other?

If we set aside all of that, the actual judges have been poor. XFUSA's Cowell has none of the teeth that Idol's Cowell had, likely because the stakes were (and are) significantly raised for XF. He left a hit show to start XF and both franchises are failing as a direct result. (More on that later.) Paula Abdul was brought in to prop up the show and mine nostalgia for her and Cowell being paired up, but the truth is she's always been a bad judge who only got less coherent each season that passed on Idol. Couple that with all of her acts being eliminated halfway into the live shows and it's a no-brainer that she only lasted one season. Nicole Scherzinger as a mid-audition replacement for Cheryl Cole had the odds stacked strongly against her, and she still couldn't have handled it more poorly. The Rachel Crow debacle stands as perhaps the grandest dick move by a judge on any show. Had Krajcik not been her contestant she probably wouldn't have shown up for the last 3 weeks and I doubt anyone would have minded. Britney Spears must have seemed like the biggest get of all time by a singshow, and it was for absolutely nothing. They paid her millions and gifted her a strong category and she couldn't even feign interest in meaningful participation, and if that wasn't enough she didn't goose the ratings a bit. LA Reid lacked charisma and mostly played the big daddy record executive role. Then he won S2 and promptly quit the show to manage the second runner-up instead. Demi Lovato has made the best of her time on the show and has good chemistry with Cowell, but she's also had weak contestants. Kelly Rowland has been an excellent addition. Paulina Rubio has not.

2. Bad Hosts

It can be difficult to judge how important it is to have an effective host if all you see are effective hosts. XFUSA demonstrates the value of the emcee by showing exactly how much it can impact the proceedings, and my god have they written the book on how not to host a show. When the most positive note you can give to any of the three people who have held the position is "pretty creepy" then something has gone terribly wrong. Even the producers know they have a problem with their hosts: the S2 auditions took place without even a voiceover to narrate the proceedings. It made for truly bizarre television that I still can't believe made it to air.

Steve Jones was charmless, cold, and stiff as could be. He also had no control over the show and at times seemed to be begging the judges (particularly Cowell) to cooperate so the show could go on. Clearly sensing that hosting XFUSA was too much work for one incompetent person, they brought in two for S2. Khloe Kardashian had no business being there at all and still managed to embarrass herself every week, culminating with her ouster not even a month after the season closed. Left to fend for himself is the wooden and creepy Mario Lopez, whose compulsive touching of contestants never fails to discomfort. He also has no control over the show and seems to be struggling to catch up at all times. XFUSA has made me appreciate Ryan Seacrest to the point of admiration, and the viewers like it when the producers and host run a tight ship. XF has been difficult to watch even at its best.

3. Technical Difficulties

Because it runs in the Fall, XFUSA's schedule is beholden to baseball above all else, and taking 2-4 weeks off before starting the live shows kills any momentum they may have. It's worth noting that S3 is the first time a rain delay didn't affect the broadcast order of the show. Nothing hurts a fledgling show more than the impression of unreliability. Cowell himself openly mocked the network after they botched the S2 judges' house results and were forced to run it again on another night.

For all of the money they spend on the show's staging (which has very clearly been significantly reduced for S3) you'd think they could hire some decent camerahands and audio engineers or a capable live director. Alas, they have not. It comes across as overpriced and inept at all times. The dolly shot that opened the first S3 live show following Lopez from backstage to on-stage was as cool of a trick as the show has ever pulled off, but the bar is still so low.

4. Bad Format

The key to American Idol's success was its democracy. The viewer felt like a part of the show and that their opinion and participation mattered and had an impact on the way the seasons would play out. Until the last 3 weeks of live shows The X Factor doesn't need your votes unless the judges DEADLOCK which has only happened 3 times in the show's short history. One of those times it was because Scherzinger didn't want to make a decision between Marcus Canty and Rachel Crow which led to the low point of the series, after which the show all but directly blamed the viewers for Crow's meltdown and Canty went home the next week anyway. The money move would have been to fire Scherzinger on-air the next week and have the long-vestigial Paula take over coaching Josh. She wasn't a fun villain like Cowell used to be; people actively hated her and frankly she didn't perform her job up to any reasonable expectation by simply deferring to the voters.

They made a bad situation even worse in S2 by ranking the performers every week post-elimination and talking about who was ticking up or down the chart. Tate and Carly Rose kept passing the #1 spot back and forth so there was no suspense about who would be in the finale other than the eventual 3rd place finisher (LYLAS 1432 Fifth Harmony - more on them later). Anyone who wasn't a fan of either of those two must have gotten pretty frustrated by their favorites never breaking out of the pack, to say nothing of the inexplicable and hilarious resiliency of one CeCe Frey, inarguably XFUSA's surrogate Sanjaya Malakar.

Looming large over S3 is the fact that the producers have shown that they will change their mind about a final decision, even one that's already aired. In S1 Simon brought back Melanie Amaro without eliminating someone else and she went on to win the season, which gave the show a strong air of being preordained. In S2 Spears eliminated Diamond White to make her top 4 in a real head-scratcher, and the "judges" brought her back the next week, again without eliminating someone else. Things like this make XFUSA seem unsure of itself and unwilling to stand by its brand. Idol made it A Big Deal when they decided to make the Top 12 the Top 13. With XFUSA it's just a thing that happens.

What if Diamond White had won S2? Do you think anyone would be watching S3? Oh right, no one is anyway.

5. The Contestants

I'm not going to go too far into this because Wizardryo's covered it extensively. This tragic Wiki page says it as well as I ever could. Melanie Amaro (the show's first winner) has a shelved album with Epic and recently made her Broadway debut. The most successful acts are S2's 3rd (Fifth Harmony) and 4th place (Emblem3) Groups acts. Without a champion to point to, The X-Factor exists in a strange vacuum where success doesn't seem to be a possibility despite the much-vaunted $5m recording contract - which is just as well since the talent pool gets more and more shallow every season. At least half of the finalists this year are mediocre at best.

6. Unmet Expectations

Cowell leaving Idol hurt their brand considerably and it hasn't recovered. At the time he said that XFUSA having anything less than 20 million viewers would be "a disappointment" to him. He since clarified that the show would eventually grow to have 20 million viewers, not that it would debut to that number. Either way he must be one disappointed motherfucker because the show debuted to 12.5m and the S1 finale earned 12.6m and those remain the high watermarks of the show. S2 peaked at 10.2m, and S3 has yet to exceed 8m and most recently got 4.9m, far less than half its initial audience and a paltry 1.5 in the key demo. Its return to the timeslot this week will ultimately determine whether or not it gets a 4th season but it's rather unlikely.

    What do XFUSA's S4 chances hinge on, at this point?


After considering all of this, the question isn't whether or not the show can be saved - but rather if it should be.
