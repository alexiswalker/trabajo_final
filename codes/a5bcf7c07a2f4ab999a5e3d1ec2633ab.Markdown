Reia
====

FYI: Reia is defunct. No additional work on it is planned. If you are
interested in the ideas behind Reia, I strongly suggest you check out
the Elixir language, which is now in a more mature stage of development
than Reia:

About
-----

Welcome to Reia (pronounced RAY-uh), a Ruby-like scripting language for the 
Erlang virtual machine (BEAM).

Want to know more about Reia? Syntax examples and that sort of thing? Please
visit the home page at:

Compiling Reia
--------------

Reia requires Erlang version R12B-3 (5.6.3) or later. The latest version of 
Erlang is available here:

[http://www.erlang.org/download.html](http://www.erlang.org/download.html)

You'll also need Ruby and Rake installed.  To compile Reia, type:

   rake

After compilation is complete, you'll see the test suite run and if everything
went well it should hopefully pass.

Implementation
--------------

Here's some thoroughly interesting implementation trivia about Reia:

* Leex-based scanner
* Yecc-based grammar (a Neotoma-based branch is also available)
* Successive parse transforms convert Reia parse trees into the Erlang abstract
  format, then into BEAM/HiPE bytecode
