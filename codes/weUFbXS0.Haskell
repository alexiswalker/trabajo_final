square :: Integer -> Integer
square n = n*n
 
sqsq :: Integer -> Integer
sqsq = square . square -- here we use function composition.

-- So what if I wanted to do something like
add :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
add n m = n+m

addsq :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
addsq n m = square (add n m) -- but instead off doing it this way is there a way to do this using . --- e.g by doing 
square . add 
-- but I tried this and it's not valid
