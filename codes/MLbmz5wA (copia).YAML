#    be used to define how many combo's player has. You can also use %is sneaking% as well as %attacker is sneaking%, %victim is sneaking% 
#    (eg. %is sneaking% = true : %continue%) As well as %is on fire%, can be used with %victim/attacker is on fire% (returns true/false)
#    You can use %mob type% variable for KILL_MOB and ATTACK_MOB, to get mob in the event, e.g.: (CREEPER, CAVE_SPIDER, ZOMBIE)
