## Beta 7

- `InsertNodeCommand` should be provided with `config.nodeType` (similar to AnnotationCommand). While old code should still work right now, this will probably break in future.
- `editorSession.setSelection()` does not require explicit specification of
  `containerId` in most cases. Instead the information is derived from the
  surface if a `surfaceId` is given.
- Refactored MarkersManager:
  + generalized and streamlined API (no custom Node necessary anymore)
  + Markers are added cleared using `MarkersManager.setMarkers(key, markers)`
    and  `MarkersManager.clearMarkers(key)`
  + EditorSession.startFlow() must be called to roll-out changes of markers
  + SpellChecker has been updated accordingly
- Introduced `DOMElement.emit(event, data)` for custom events
- Improved several Commands (new option `disableCollapsedCursor`, disable when cursor on InlineNode)
- Surface allows to override core key event handlers via KeyboardManager
- Surface emits `tab` event
- Introduced `DocumentChange.info.skipSelectionRerender` to skip rendering the selection
- Introduced InsertTableCommand
- Introduced TextInputPackage
- Toolbox now rerenders on every change
- Introduced white-/black-list of commands to control which Commands are available in a specific Surface
- **(!)** changed the order of `Component.didMount()` call, now top-to-down, was bottom-to-up before
- InsertNodeCommand now sets cursor into inserted node
- TextPropertyComponent allows to render markers passed via props (as opposed to markers provided by MarkersManager)
- TextPropertyEditor emits 'enter' event
- Improved re-rendering performance
- Improved API for commands and tools
- `Container.show(nodeId, pos)` is deprecated.
  Use either `Container.show(nodeId)` or `Container.showAt(pos, nodeId)`
- `el.appendChild(null)` does not throw
- `el.insertBefore(child, null)` is equivalent to `el.appendChild(child)`
- `surface.focus()` now behaves similar to a HTML input element, i.e. setting the cursor to the first position
- fixed selection rendering for IsolatedNodes

These changes might break your current implementation and may need some migration:

- Changed behavior of `DefaultDOMElement.parseHTML()` and `parseXML()`:
  Now `DefaultDOMElement.parseHTML()` and `parseXML()` always return the DOM document, i.e., a `DOMElement` instance of type `document`.
  The former behavior was confusing and inconsistent.
  `parseHTML()` now always creates a 'full' HTML document, i.e. containing `<head>` and `<body>`

  If you want to parse *snippets* (as opposed to full documents), use:
  ```
    let el = DefaultDOMElement.parseSnippet('<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>', 'html')
    let els = DefaultDOMElement.parseSnippet('Lorem ipsum <b>dolor</b> sit amet', 'xml')

    ...or...

    let el = DefaultDOMElement.parseSnippet('<myNode>...</myNode>', 'xml')
    let els = DefaultDOMElement.parseSnippet('<myNode>...</myNode><myNode>...</myNode>', 'xml')
  ```
  Notice, that `parseSnippet` returns either one element, or an array of elements, depending on the input you provided.

-  `MemoryDOMElement` now always encodes and decodes entities. If you had
   your own workarounds in place, you might need to disable them now.

- `DOMImporter` (`HTMLImporter`/`XMLImporter`) takes two mandatory configuration parameters: `schema` and `converters`
  If you have used the `Configurator` API to create importers and exporters, you should be good.

- Changed signature of `Data` and `InrementalData` constructor: The second argument is now a node factory
  ```
  new IncrementalData(schema, this.nodeFactory)
  ```
- Removed some API which we don't want to support anymore:
  - `DOMElement.getRoot()`: use `el.getOwnerDocument()` instead
  - `Selection.getFragments()`: implementation was overly complicated.
    If you want to iterate nodes of a container selection use `sel.getNodeIds()`
  - `documentHelpers.getAnnotationsForSelection()`: use `documentHelpers.getPropertyAnnotation()` instead
  - `Document.fromSnapshot()`, `Document.loadSeed()`: both implementations were not reliable. Use `JSONConverter` instead.

- Changed API for configuring editing tools
  - Instead of assigning a `toolGroup` to a tool, we assign `commandGroup` to a command

    ```
    config.addCommand('heading1', SwitchTextTypeCommand, {
      spec: { type: 'heading', level: 1 }
      commandGroup: 'text-types'
    })
    config.addCommand('heading2', SwitchTextTypeCommand, {
      spec: { type: 'heading', level: 2 },
      commandGroup: 'text-types'
    })
    config.addCommand('heading3', SwitchTextTypeCommand, {
      spec: { type: 'heading', level: 3 },
      commandGroup: 'text-types'
    })
    config.addKeyboardShortcut('CommandOrControl+alt+1', { command: 'heading1' })
    config.addKeyboardShortcut('CommandOrControl+alt+2', { command: 'heading2' })
    config.addKeyboardShortcut('CommandOrControl+alt+3', { command: 'heading3' })
    ```
  - Toolbars, overlays, context menus are now configured explicitly via `config.addToolPane`

    ```
    config.addToolPanel('main-overlay', [
      {
        type: 'tool-group',
        commandGroups: ['prompt']
      }
    ])

    config.addToolPanel('main-toolbar', [
      {
        name: 'text-types',
        type: 'tool-dropdown',
        showDisabled: true,
        style: 'descriptive',
        commandGroups: ['text-types']
      },
      {
        name: 'annotations',
        type: 'tool-group',
        showDisabled: true,
        style: 'minimal',
        commandGroups: ['annotations']
      },
      {
        name: 'insert',
        type: 'tool-group',
        showDisabled: true,
        style: 'minimal',
        commandGroups: ['insert']
      }
    ])
    ```

  - When no tool component is registered (`config.addTool`) for a command, `ToggleTool` is used.

  - `AbstractEditor` is not registering a global `keydown` handler automatically. You should do this in your top-level component on `didMount()`.
  - `Surface.onKeydown()` does not prevent or stop the event, if no keyboard shortcut and no built-in handler is attached.
  > This might need to be revised

- DEPRECATIONS:
  - `DocumentChange.isAffected()`: Use `DocumentChange.hasUpdated()` instead
